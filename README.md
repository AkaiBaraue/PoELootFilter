# Nasaug's Loot Filter

## 2016-03-12 changes:

 - Changed background colors of some things. Currency is now slightly lighter (to make it easier to read), maps are blue, div cards are purple and 6S, 5L and 6L are green. Uniques have a completely black background.
 - Added tiers to currency, maps, div cards and uniques. There are three tiers: low-, mid- and high-tier. They are indicated by the border around the item. Low-tier is whitish, mid-tier is yellowish and high-tier is reddish. Currency futhermore has a "below low-tier" which has a black border.
 - Changed font size of a lot of crap. "Standard" size is now 32 instead of 35. Low-tier stuff is 36, mid-tier is 40 and high-tier is 44.
 - Rares have two font sizes now: 36 for anything that could be a good base item (stuff that only drops from level 60+ zones, jewellery and jewels) and 32 for everything else. The border colors are the same.
