# Nasaug's Loot Filter

This filter is based on a [Sayya's loot filter](https://github.com/SayyadinaAtreides/sayya-poe-filter) from back when loot filters were introduced. I have, since then, made a lot of changes to make it fit my needs better.

The filter uses a combination of background color (item groups) and border color/font size together (how valuable an item is within the group) to denote what an item is and how valuable it is.

Background colors:
 - Red = PICK ME UP
 - Purple = Divination Cards
 - Blue = Maps
 - Teal = Sacrifice Fragments
 - Green = 6S, 5L and 6L Items
 - Brown = Currency

Border colors and font size:
 - Red, size 44 = Extremely valuable
 - Orange, size 40 = Valuable
 - White, size 36 = Uncommon items
 - Black, size 32 = Common items (currency only) 

Other than the above-mentioned, there are multiple smaller things that are fairly easy to figure out during play.
